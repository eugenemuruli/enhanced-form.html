# HTML5 Content & Form Mastery

This project demonstrates advanced use of **HTML5** to create a structured, accessible, and user-friendly web page with native form validation — all without JavaScript.

🎯 Submitted as part of the assignment: *"Enhancing HTML5 Content & Mastering Forms"*

## 🧩 Features

✅ **Semantic HTML5 Structure**  
- Uses `<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, `<fieldset>`, and other semantic tags for clarity and accessibility.

✅ **Organized Content**  
- **Lists**: Display key web design features.
- **Table**: Shows a comparison of HTML5 input types and their uses.

✅ **Embedded Media**  
- Includes a sample video using `<video>` and audio using `<audio>` with fallback support.

✅ **Interactive Form with Native Validation**  
- Includes various input types: `text`, `email`, `tel`, `date`, `number`, `password`, `url`, `color`, `textarea`, and `select`.
- Uses HTML5 validation attributes:
  - `required`
  - `minlength` / `maxlength`
  - `pattern` (for phone & password rules)
  - `min` / `max` (for age and date)
  - `type="email"` and `type="url"` for format validation
- Fully accessible with:
  - Proper `<label>` associations
  - `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` for grouping
  - `placeholder`, `autocomplete`, and clear visual feedback

🚫 **No JavaScript used** — validation is 100% native HTML5.
